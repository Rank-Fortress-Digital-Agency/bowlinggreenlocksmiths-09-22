                        <h2>
                            You’ve Locked Yourself Out

                        <p>
                            This is probably the most common reason people need to call a locksmith. Whether you’ve lost your keys or simply locked yourself out of your house or car, a locksmith can help you get back in. Most locksmiths are available 24 hours a day and can usually be to you within 30 minutes or less.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Locksmiths can also make duplicate keys, which can be handy if you want to give a spare key to a friend or family member. They can also rekey your locks, which is helpful if you’ve lost a key and don’t want anyone who finds it to access your home or business. Additionally, locksmiths can install new locks, which is a good idea if you’re moving into a new home or office.

In addition, locksmiths can also change the locks on your home or business if you’ve lost your keys or if you think someone else has a copy of your key.
